# the-donald-trumpet
Command line utility for OS-x which subscribes to Donald Trump's tweets and reads them to you.

![If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to "tweet." Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!](https://github.com/markmliu/the-donald-trumpet/blob/master/images/ex1.png "Tweet example")


# Set up:
Get API keys from twitter and create an api_keys file in same directory which declares the necessary api keys.
For example:

~~~~
#Variables that contains the user credentials to access Twitter API
access_token = "$$$"
access_token_secret = "$$$"
consumer_key = "$$$"
consumer_secret = "$$$"
~~~~
